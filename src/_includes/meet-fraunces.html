		<h2>Meet Fraunces, an “Old Style” typeface.</h2>

		<p>
			In the early summer of 2018, Google Fonts approached us with the
			challenge of designing a display typeface. I spent some time
			perusing the catalog, and was struck by a pretty big hole in the
			typographic voices available. There isn’t a specific name for this
			genre, but typefaces such as Cooper Black, Windsor, and Souvenir
			personify it. We’ve played alot with this style in our lettering
			work, and felt this was a create opportunity to create a typeface
			family.

			The origin of this genre traces its roots back to the Arts & Crafts
			experimentations of the late 1800's—early 1900's. Golden Type by
			William Morris, and the extensive lettering of the Roycroft Guild
			captured this romanticized idea of an “Old Style” that their
			contemporaries had lost touch with. Morris’ Golden Type was an
			extremely crude interpretation of the types of Nicolas Jenson,
			opting instead to emphasize the perceived effects of printing,
			rather than the calligraphic origins of the form.

			Ironically, the letters they created, and the fad of wonky “Old
			Style” typefaces that it spawned in subsequent decades (such as
			Cooper Black, Windsor, Clearface) had little-to-nothing to do with
			typefaces of antiquity. These typefaces veered more on the “goofy”
			side, whereas Richardson Old Style by Robert DeLittle showcased some
			of the more elegant possibilities of this expressive approach.

		<p>
			Fast forward to the 1970's, when graphic designers were looking for
			more funky stylings, and the irreverence of these typefaces were the
			perfect antidote to the perceived stuffiness of traditional text
			faces. Ed Benguiat drew a swashy version of Bookman for ITC, an ode
			to Oswald Cooper’s Cooper Black Italic, which has become ubiquitous
			with the “Thank You For Shopping With Us” grocery bags.
		</p>

		<p>
			Fraunces is not an Old Style typeface, but an “Old Style” typeface.
			That is, a genre of type that is less concerned with sensible
			construction of letterforms, and personality is always paramount.
