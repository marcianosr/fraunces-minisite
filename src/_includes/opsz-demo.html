		<h2>Ask me about my Optical Size Axis</h2>
		<p>
			The Optical Size axis is similar to the Goofy, in that it controls
			the overall contrast between thicks and thins. The Optical Size axis
			goes a step further, however, and factors in additional changes
			depending on the size of the font. At smaller sizes, the
			letterspacing opens up, x-height increases, and contrast decreases
			to allow for easier reading. Additionally, at 18 pt/px and below,
			substitutions for the “wonky” characters are made automatically (see
			the Wonk Axis explanation below).
