		<h2>The Optical Size Axis</h2>
		<p>
			The Optical Size axis is similar to the Goofy, in that it controls
			the overall contrast between thicks and thins. But, the Optical Size
			axis goes a step further and factors in additional changes depending
			on the size of the font. At smaller sizes, the letterspacing opens
			up, x-height increases, and contrast decreases to allow for easier
			reading. On the opposite page are examples of the Goofy Min, which
			changes in Optical Size at different font sizes. Most modern web
			browsers will automatically interpret this information. Designing in
			applications such as Adobe Illustrator or Sketch requires a manual
			approach to typesetting.
